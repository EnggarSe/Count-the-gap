Write a function that could receive a number as a parameter. The function should convert the parameter to a binary number. Then, find the highest gap (zeros between number 1) in one binary number. Return the highest gap of the binary number. <br>
example :   Input: 529 <br>
            Output : 4 <br>
Why? The binary number of 529 is 1000010001. There are two gaps, one is 4 and one is 3. The highest gap of them all is 4, therefore the output is 4.
